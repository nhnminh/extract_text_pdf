order to be less dependent on public funding. They also need to prepare future
evolutions of their business model (e.g. public transport gratuity). Our mission
was to help several subsidiaries identify & quantify new sources of revenues.

• Belonging to an international banking group, the bank has been present in Morocco for 
more than a century. Historically positioned in the Mass Affluent customer segment, the 
bank, resolutely committed to a sustainable development strategy, wishes to address all 
Moroccan individual customers.
In order to reduce the use of cash and promote financial inclusion, the bank launched a 
study with ANRT to deploy a national mobile payment solution.  This study follows the 
implementation of the new banking law and the publication of two circulars: one on the 
operating conditions of payment institutions and the other on payment services.
In this context, VERTONE was asked to assist the Bank's Executive Board in monitoring the 
work on the market, designing a new Mobile Payment and Low-Income Banking (LIB) activity 
and negotiating the first distribution activities.
